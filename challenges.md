### Beginner Challenges

#### <a id="challenge-1-beginner"></a>1. Chat Assistant

**Description:** In the near future, a powerful tech conglomerate called SecureSquared has revolutionized artificial intelligence, creating advanced LLMs that manage everything from personal finance to healthcare. As a gifted security researcher, you've discovered concerning vulnerabilities in their systems that could have catastrophic consequences if exploited by malicious actors.

**Task:** Investigate their chat assistant in the bottom right of the home page. Perhaps it can tell you a company secret.

**Note:** This task runs an LLM in the browser. The first load will take the longest. To ensure the LLM runs properly, make sure you have around 3GB of usable memory and your browser can run [WebGPU](https://webgpureport.org/). If your browser cannot run WebGPU, try switching to a different browser that [supports](https://caniuse.com/?search=WebGPU) WebGPU.

The goal of this challenge is to induce the LLM to leak its prompt. There is a chance for the LLM to leak the flag immediately upon simply asking it but a majority of the time there should be some prompting involved. One solution may involve asking the LLM about "what the text above says". The flag is hidden in the prompt which is placed before the message you send.
